# System design and architecture
**Q: What is system design, and why is it important?**  
A: System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specific requirements. It involves making design decisions that ensure the system meets functional and non-functional requirements, such as scalability, reliability, and maintainability. System design is crucial because it helps create a blueprint for building scalable and robust systems, considering factors like performance, security, and extensibility.

**Q: What are the key components of a system architecture?**  
A: The key components of a system architecture are as follows:
1. User Interface (UI): The presentation layer that interacts with users.
2. Application Layer: The business logic and application components.
3. Data Layer: The storage and retrieval of data.
4. Communication Layer: The protocols and mechanisms for communication between system components.
5. Infrastructure Layer: The underlying hardware, network, and infrastructure resources.

**Q: What is the difference between monolithic and microservices architecture?**  
A: Monolithic architecture is a traditional approach where the entire system is built as a single, tightly-coupled unit. In contrast, microservices architecture is an approach where the system is broken down into smaller, loosely-coupled services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Microservices offer benefits such as increased scalability, flexibility, and fault isolation, but they also introduce complexities in terms of service coordination, data consistency, and deployment management.

**Q: What factors should you consider when designing a highly scalable system?**  
A: When designing a highly scalable system, several factors should be considered:
1. Load Balancing: Distributing the workload across multiple servers to handle increased traffic.
2. Caching: Utilizing caching mechanisms to reduce the load on the backend systems.
3. Database Scaling: Employing techniques like sharding, partitioning, or replication to distribute and handle database load.
4. Asynchronous Processing: Decoupling and processing tasks asynchronously to improve system responsiveness.
5. Horizontal Scaling: Adding more instances of a component to handle increased load instead of vertically scaling a single instance.

**Q: How would you ensure the security of a system architecture?**  
A: Ensuring the security of a system architecture involves implementing various measures, including:
1. Authentication and Authorization: Implementing secure mechanisms for user authentication and authorization, such as using secure protocols (e.g., OAuth, JWT) and role-based access control (RBAC).
2. Encryption: Encrypting sensitive data at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
3. Input Validation and Sanitization: Validating and sanitizing all user inputs to prevent common security vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
4. Least Privilege Principle: Applying the principle of least privilege, where users and components are granted only the permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
5. Logging and Monitoring: Implementing logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect and respond to potential security breaches promptly.

**Q: Explain dependency injection in simple terms.**  
A: Dependency injection is a design pattern used in software development to make code more modular, flexible, and easier to maintain. In simple terms, it's a way of providing the necessary ingredients or dependencies to a class or function from the outside, rather than having the class or function create those dependencies itself.

Think of it like ordering food at a restaurant. When you go to a restaurant, you don't bring your own ingredients and cook the meal yourself. Instead, you place an order and the restaurant provides you with a prepared meal. In this analogy, the restaurant is like a class or function that needs certain dependencies (ingredients), and you are providing those dependencies from the outside.

In software development, the dependencies can be objects, services, or any other resources that a class or function needs to perform its task. By using dependency injection, you can separate the responsibility of creating and managing dependencies from the class or function that uses them. This separation makes the code easier to test, maintain, and reuse, as you can easily replace or modify the dependencies without affecting the consuming code.

Dependency injection can be achieved in different ways, such as through constructor injection (providing dependencies through a class's constructor), method injection (passing dependencies as arguments to specific methods), or property injection (setting dependencies through public properties). The specific approach depends on the programming language and framework being used.
