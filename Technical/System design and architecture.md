# System design and architecture

**Q: Explain dependency injection in simple terms.**  
A: Dependency injection is a design pattern used in software development to make code more modular, flexible, and easier to maintain. In simple terms, it's a way of providing the necessary ingredients or dependencies to a class or function from the outside, rather than having the class or function create those dependencies itself.

Think of it like ordering food at a restaurant. When you go to a restaurant, you don't bring your own ingredients and cook the meal yourself. Instead, you place an order and the restaurant provides you with a prepared meal. In this analogy, the restaurant is like a class or function that needs certain dependencies (ingredients), and you are providing those dependencies from the outside.

In software development, the dependencies can be objects, services, or any other resources that a class or function needs to perform its task. By using dependency injection, you can separate the responsibility of creating and managing dependencies from the class or function that uses them. This separation makes the code easier to test, maintain, and reuse, as you can easily replace or modify the dependencies without affecting the consuming code.

Dependency injection can be achieved in different ways, such as through constructor injection (providing dependencies through a class's constructor), method injection (passing dependencies as arguments to specific methods), or property injection (setting dependencies through public properties). The specific approach depends on the programming language and framework being used.
